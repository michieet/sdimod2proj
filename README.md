- This app accepts a location input from the user, and returns the parking lot availability data of HDB carparks within 1 km radius of said location.
- Google map API is used to analyse the input from the user, and it returns the lat and long of lcoation entered.
- HDB parking lot availability and information data is provided by [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/carpark-availability) and [HDB](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/hdb-carpark-information) accordingly.
- To ensure up to date data, parking lot availability data is retrieved every 5 seconds, while the information data is retrieved once whenever the app starts.
